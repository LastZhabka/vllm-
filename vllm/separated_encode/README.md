# MLLM Encode separation and E-P Encoder Cache Transfer


Encode-Prefill-Decode disaggregation provides greater flexibility in distributed MLLM inference, enables better resource utilization under fixed TTFT and TPOT Service Level Objectives, and allows for the application of stage-level optimizations. To implement the EPD full disaggregation, we need to move the visual encoder to a separate instance. 

This update introduces the implementation of MLLM visual encoder separation, an abstraction for inter-instance (E-P) communication for encoder cache transfer, and a concrete example implementation of disaggregated E+PD serving.

## Motivation

1. Encoder separation is a critical part of EPD disaggregation, as it allows the visual encoder to be decoupled from the Prefill and Decode stages. To implement and use EPD disaggregation in future we need a visual encoder separation.

2. Better serving for MLLM. Consider mixed inputs continuous serving scenario, every 10th request includes a large multimodal input, while all others are text-only. In the current vLLM, all requests in a batch in model execution will wait for the multimodal input embedding generation to complete. When new request with the image arrive, all requests will again wait for the multimodal (MM) encoder to run, causing significant performance degradation. By separating the encoding stage, we can avoid these bottleneck. This scenario is used only to highlight the bottleneck, same bottleneck appears in other serving scenarios and can be fixed by separated encoder.

## Overall Process (Sequential requests)
 
The separated encode overall process in 1E1PD with proxy scenario:

1. The client sends an HTTP request to the Proxy/Router's /v1/completions interface.
2. The Proxy/Router selects a 1E1PD (1 Encode instance + 1 Prefill+Decode instance) generates a request_id.
3. Proxy sends request to E instance. 
4. When request is scheduled on the E instance, the request's metadata is sent to PD instance through Encoder Cache connector.
5. Then multimodal embeddings are generated for request's multimodal inputs, the multimodal embeddings are scheduled for the transfer in encoder cache connector on E instance and empty response is returned to proxy immediately after generation of the multimodal embeddings is completed. 
6. After receiving response from E instance, the Proxy/Router forwards the request to the PD instance. As encoder budget is set to 0 on PD instance, it can't schedule chunks with multimodal input and waits the injection of encoder cache.
7. When there is enough space in the encoder cache manager on the PD instance, instance preallocates the space for request and sends a preallocation notification to the E instance. If the encoder cache is not required (i.e., tokens are reused via the KV cache), it sends a "failed" preallocation notification, indicating that encoder cache transfer is not required.
8. After preallocation notification is received on E instance's EC connector the encoder cache is sent from E instance to the PD instance. 
9. PD instance receives cache and finalize allocation of the multimodal input data and now is able to schedule the request. As encoder cache is already calculated PD instance skips MLLM's encode step and uses the value from cache.
10. After completing Prefill and Decode, the PD instance returns the result to the Proxy/Router, which then forwards it to the client.

# Implementation

The implementation avoids large changes. Modifications to the model runner are minimal, and the main functionality is provided through model runner wrapper classes, which are only instantiated during the execution of the separated encoder. Same with scheduler, changes in the scheduler are all handled by the condition if self.separated_encode, ensuring that the default VLLM serving remains unaffected. These changes only take effect during execution with the separated multimodal encoder

## vLLM minor changes

### Scheduler routing
**Files:** `vllm/v1/core/core.py`

During execution with EPD disaggregation, EngineCore now uses the Encoder Scheduler for the Encode instance.

### EPD Disaggregation Configuration
**Files:** `vllm/config/__init__.py`, `vllm/core/arg_utils.py`

Added a new configuration class for EPD disaggregation. Currently supports configuration of instance type, instance's EPD rank and the number of connector workers.

### Additional ModelRunnerOutput Data Fields
**Files:** `vllm/v1/outputs.py`

The model runner output now includes two additional data fields: `transfered_mm_data` and `injected_mm_data`.

The `transfered_mm_data` field passes a list of transfered encoder cache input IDs from the model runner to the scheduler on the encode instance. After receiving transfered data IDs, the scheduler will clear free space in the encoder cache manager.

The `injected_mm_data` field passes a list of injected encoder cache input IDs with `mm_hash` from the model runner to the scheduler on the prefill instance. After receiving injected data IDs, the scheduler will finalize allocations 

### Model Runner Wrapper Integration in GPUWorker
**Files:** `vllm/v1/worker/gpu_worker.py`

When EPD disaggregation is enabled, the system uses wrapper classes of GPUModelRunner class.

### GPU Model Runner santiy check in encoder execution
**Files:** `vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`

If EPD disaggregated serving is enabled, an additional attribute is added to indicate whether encoder execution is allowed. This attribute is used to perform a sanity check on each execution of the encoder. Also encoder cache lock is added to ensure encoder cache injection safety. 

## Major Changes

### EncoderCacheManager new Allocation Logic
**Files:** `vllm/v1/core/encoder_cache_manager.py`

In disaggregated settings, encoder outputs need to be transferred between instances. This creates timing challenges: we must reserve cache space before receiving the data, but we can't mark it as cached until the transfer completes. For that the EncoderCacheManager now supports a two-stage allocation process for handling encoder outputs receiving. The two-stage process addresses this by separating reservation from finalization.

The `preallocate()` method reserves cache space for incoming encoder outputs. It tracks which requests need which multimodal inputs and prevents premature eviction of entries that will be reused. This method returns whether the encoder output needs to be computed and transferred `(true)` or is already available in cache `(false)`.

The `finalize_allocation()` method completes the allocation after encoder outputs are received. It converts the preallocation into an actual cached entry or releases the reservation if another request provided the data or mm input tokens prefilling is skipped due to prefix caching.

To prevent race conditions between eviction and incoming transfers, we don't evict caches that have active preallocations(not finalized allocations*).

### EncoderCachePreallocator
**Files:** `vllm/separated_encode/sched/encoder_cache_preallocator.py`
The EncoderCachePreallocator schedules preallocation requests. It synchronizes incoming requests with encoder metadata received asynchronously from encoding instances. The preallocator serves three essential purposes:

It synchronizes request arrival with encoder metadata reception. Since encoder metadata can arrive before or after the corresponding request, the preallocator buffers metadata for requests that haven't arrived yet and processes waiting metadata when requests do arrive.

It manages the preallocation queue to determine for which encode output when cache space should be reserved. The system maintains a queue of pending preallocations and validates each candidate against available cache capacity before proceeding with reservation. 

It tracks multimodal input processing progress to avoid unnecessary data transfers. When inputs are obtained from existing caches (KV cache or encoder cache), the preallocator sends notifications to cancel pending transfers and ignores subsequent metadata for those inputs.

The system provides an abstract base class `EncoderCachePreallocatorTemplate` that defines the interface for preallocation strategies. This template initializes the encoder cache connector for receiving metadata and defines abstract methods that concrete implementations must provide. And one concrete synchronous implementation example.

#### Request flow

When encoder metadata arrives via the `_receive_encoder_cache_metadata` callback, the preallocator checks if the request is active. For active requests, it immediately schedules preallocation. For inactive requests, it stores the metadata in `waiting_preallocs` for later processing.

Request addition triggers processing of any waiting metadata. The `add_request` method initializes tracking structures and schedules preallocations for any metadata that arrived early.

As the tokens are processed, `update_mm_inputs_done` tracks which multimodal inputs are complete. When a pending input is covered by existing cache, the system sends a cancellation notification and marks it as ignored.

The `get_prealloc_candidate` method provides the interface for retrieving candidates from the queue. It validates each candidate against available space and skips ignored entries. The method returns whether to continue processing and the candidate data if valid. In the scheduler this method is called from `_perform_preallocations` method.

```mermaid

    E->>PD: "I have 2048 tokens of encoder cache to send"
    Note over PD: Check available memory
    PD->>PD: encoder_cache_manager.can_preallocate(2048 tokens)
    alt Multimodal input tokens KV values are not obtained from KV cache
        PD->>PD: encoder_cache_manager.preallocate(req_id, input_id, 2048 tokens)
        PD->>E: "I reserved 2048 tokens for you"
        Note over E: Now safe to send
        E->>PD: Send actual 2048 tokens data
        Note over PD: After successful injection
        PD->>PD: encoder_cache_manager.finalize_allocation(req_id, input_id)
    else Multimodal input tokens KV values are obtained from KV cache
        PD->>PD: encoder_cache_manager.depreallocate(req_id, input_id)
        PD->>E: "No need to send"
    end
```


### Encoder Scheduler

#### Encoder Scheduler (encode)
**Files:** `vllm/separated_encode/sched/encoder_scheduler.py`

Separate EncoderScheduler class implementation is provided for encode instance scheduling.

The EncoderScheduler is a specialized scheduler for encode instances that focuses on only multimodal input scheduling. It maintains an `_allocated` dictionary to track allocated encoder cache entries, their sizes and hashes. This dictionary is used to allow us to free up logical space without storing the request itself, which enables us to end the request before the data is transferred.

Currently the encode scheduler schedules all multimodal inputs for a request at once in the `schedule()` method. It checks if there's sufficient encoder cache space and budget before allocating all inputs together. A request on the encode instance is considered finished when all its multimodal embeddings have been computed, so all requests are finished in 1 iteration after scheduling, transfer is handled separately in encoder cache connectors, space allocated for encoder cache is deallocated only after transfers, not after request finish.

In the `update_from_output()` method, the scheduler goes through transferred multimodal data IDs and frees the mm inputs in encoder cache manager.

#### Main Scheduler (prefill and prefill+decode instances)
**Files:** `vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py`

For prefill and prefill+decode instances, the main scheduler is changed for multimodal inputs encode separation. 

If encoder separation is turned on, we instantiate `encoder_cache_preallocator` object in scheduler, this preallocator handles communication through `ec_connector` in it and `preallocation` scheduling and synchronization, also we set `max_num_encoder_input_tokens` to 0 to avoid the usage of the multimodal data encoder on P or PD instance.

Mostly main scheduler has 3 changes, integration of `encoder_cache_preallocator`, `_perform_preallocations()` and `injected_mm_data` allocation. 

The  `encoder_cache_preallocator` is described in the corresponding part of the documentation. The `_perform_preallocations()` function is used to connect `encoder_cache_preallocator`, which manages which requests will be preallocated, and the encoder cache manager, in which we actually performs preallocations. This function just gets the preallocation candidate from the `encode_cache_preallocator` until there are enough slots in the `encoder_cache_manager`. Perform preallocation is called 2 times: in `update_after_schedule()` after some cache can  potentially become freeable, and in `update_from_output` after handling injected data.

The injected data handling is performed via `injected_mm_data` attribute from `ModelRunnerOutput`, scheduler just going through injected data and decides whether the allocation needs to be finalized or we don't need the obtained data anymore and we can just say that this injected data is freeable.

Such implementation allows us to achieve motivation described in changes for encoder cache manager, encoder cache preallocator and also more efficiently use caching techniques in EPD context.

### Instance-Specific Model Runner Wrappers
**Files:** `vllm/separated_encode/worker/gpu_epd_lm_wrapper.py`, `vllm/separated_encode/worker/gpu_epd_vm_wrapper.py`

The implementation introduces specialized GPU model runner wrappers for disaggregated architecture, focusing on distinct roles for multimodal encoding and text generation. These wrappers are built on top of the GPUModelRunner for better compatibility with future changes in GPUModelRunner. As long as the v1 interface for GPU Model Runner remains unchanged, the wrappers do not require updates, wrapper simply call the original methods, instantiate the encoder cache connector, track information, and modify the model runner output with EPD-related information.

#### DisaggEncodeGPURunnerWrapper (Encode Instance)

This wrapper runs on encode instances and processes multimodal inputs. It executes encoder models and sends the results to other instances through encoder cache connector.

The encode instance doesn't need KV cache since it only runs vision part of MLLM. The wrapper overrides `initialize_kv_cache_tensors` and `initialize_kv_cache` to return empty results, freeing up GPU memory for larger encoder cache storage.

During execution, the wrapper executes encoding for scheduled multimodal inputs, converts outputs to numpy arrays and inserts enocder cache to encoder cache connector, also it stores. Since no text generation happens here, it returns a mostly empty ModelRunnerOutput with additional transfer status information in ModelRunnerOutput, this information is used in encoder scheduler to free the space in encoder cache manager.

#### DisaggPrefillDecodeGPURunnerWrapper (Prefill/(Prefill+Decode) Instance)

This wrapper runs on prefill or (prefill+decode) instances where the Language Model is exectued. It receives encoder cache from encode instances and injects them into the normal inference pipeline.

The wrapper uses a callback function `receive_encoder_cache` to handle incoming encoder data. This callback converts numpy arrays back to GPU tensors with the correct device and dtype, then stores them in the standard encoder_cache dictionary.

During `execute_model`, the wrapper simply calls `execute_model`, and also tracks which encoder caches were injected. It reports successful injections back to the scheduler through the model output, allowing the scheduler to finalize allocations of preallocated inputs.

### Encoder Cache Connector
**Files:** `vllm/separated_encode/ec_transfer/connector/template.py`, `vllm/separated_encode/ec_transfer/connector/redis.py`

The Encoder Cache Connector provides an abstraction layer for transferring encoder caches between encode and prefill instances in disaggregated vLLM deployments. The abstract base class ECConnectorTemplate defines the communication logic.

The connector operates using a thread-based architecture with separate send and receive event loops. Communication is handled asynchronously through configurable worker pools. It maintains separate queues for send and receive operations, with each operation executed by dedicated worker threads.

The encoder connector operates in four distinct states based on instance type and its component:

**State for Encode Scheduler** - Pure sender functionality that handles encoder cache metadata transfer. When multimodal input is scheduled, metadata sending tasks are added to the send queue for processing by the send event loop.

**State for Prefill Scheduler** - Receives encoder cache metadata from encode instances and manages preallocation through scheduler callbacks. The preallocation logic is described in scheduler updates. After successful preallocation, sends completion notifications back to encode instances from which it received the metadata.

**State for Encode Model Runner** - Manages cache storage, transfer, and lifecycle. It maintains:

- encoder_cache: Dictionary storing computed encoder caches
- cache_to_send: Set of pending cache transfers awaiting preallocation confirmation
- cache_to_avoid: Set of caches that failed preallocation
- transfered_ids: List tracking successfully transferred cache IDs

When encoder output is generated, add_encoder_cache() either stores the cache locally or immediately schedules transfer if a successful preallocation notification was already received. Upon receiving successful preallocation notifications via `_maybe_send_encoder_cache()`, it either sends the cache immediately or adds the request to the pending set. It can receive failed preallocation notification, it means that we don't need to send encoder cache to this instance and can delete the encoder cache for this (req_id, input_id) from the Encoder instance.

**State for Prefill Model Runner** - Receive-only state that accepts encoder cache data and calls injection callbacks to add the cache into the model runner's encoder cache dictionary.

The communication flow follows this sequence:

- Encode Scheduler sends metadata to Prefill Scheduler for cache preallocation
- Prefill Scheduler attempts preallocation and sends success/failure notifications to Encode Model Runner
- Upon successful preallocation, Encode Model Runner transfers the actual encoder cache data to Prefill Model Runner


The preallocation step is implemented to avoid OOM problems on the prefill instance.

The `add_encoder_cache` method also looks up pending send queries. If a cache transfer has already been requested (exists in `cache_to_send` set), it immediately schedules the send operation rather than storing the cache locally. This optimization minimizes latency by sending caches as soon as both prerequisites are met. Failed preallocations are tracked in `cache_to_avoid` to prevent unnecessary transfers

Transfer completion tracking is built into the class. Through the connector's `get_transferred_ids` method, the model runner can determine which request data has already been received.

#### Extension Example

The included `RedisECConnector` demonstrates a concrete implementation using Redis as the communication backend. To use other communication backends, implement the abstract methods `_send_prealloc_notification`, `_send_encoder_cache_metas`, `_send_encoder_cache`, `_recv_prealloc_notification`, `_recv_encoder_cache_metas`, and `_recv_encoder_cache` according to your chosen transport mechanism. This connection extension supports multiple E instances and multiple PD or P instances. 

# Usage Instructions

The system offers three different deployment options through separate scripts. The first two scripts, `launch_epd_api_server.sh` and `launch_epd_serve.sh`, are designed to run the 1E1PD disaggregation on a single device and are used in the benchmark below to illustrate the performance of the encoder separation. The third script, `launch_epd_serve_separated.sh`, enables 1E1PD disaggregation by deploying EPD across two devices.

To start the EPD instances and proxy server, select one of the provided scripts and modify the arguments as needed before execution. You can run the deployment using any of these commands:

```bash
bash examples/online_serving/separated_encode/launch_epd_serve.sh
```

```bash
bash examples/online_serving/separated_encode/launch_epd_serve_separated.sh
```

```bash
bash examples/online_serving/separated_encode/launch_epd_api_server.sh
```

After the server starts running, you can interact with it using OpenAI-compatible API requests to send queries and receive responses. Sample Python code for sending requests is available in the examples/online_serving/separated_encode/ directory, providing practical examples for integration.

The distinction between `launch_epd_api_server.sh` and `launch_epd_serve.sh`. Communication between the proxy and vLLM API introduces significant delays, likely due to the proxy implementation. For benchmarking purposes, `launch_epd_api_server.sh` was preferred as it uses a custom API server that instantiates AsyncLLMs directly, bypassing the proxy overhead. Both the proxy and API server implementations can be found in their respective directories: `examples/online_serving/separated_encode/api_server` and `examples/online_serving/separated_encode/proxy`. 

The API server implementation allows sending both requests simultaneously without waiting for the response from instance E and enables shared tokenization process. 

# Benchmark

Performance evaluation was conducted using Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on an NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPU, comparing default vllm serve against an 1E1PD with API server approach(1 GPU is used).

As mentioned in the motivation section, the results demonstrate significant improvements in TPOT, for example median TPOT is improved by at least 30% across all workloads. Due to improvement in TPOT we can also observe improvements in ITL, especially in cases where the number of inputs is significantly larger than 1 batch size. However, the increased TTFT is also observed in some cases. 

The elevated TTFT is primarily produced from two factors. First, image preprocessing occurs twice in the current implementation, creating redundant computational overhead. While this duplication introduces latency, the impact is partially mitigated through concurrent request processing to both encoder and prefill-decode instances. Second, the encoder cache transfer mechanism introduces delay in current two-step preallocation approach, where a preallocation notification is sent followed by a one iteration of model execution for the PD instance model runner, that will receive the encoder cache and return the injected IDs.

In the future the image preprocessing on PD or P instance can be removed in separated encode scenario. Also the ECConnector could be extended to utilize an intermediate caching server that stores encoder outputs and enables immediate cache delivery, eliminating the synchronization wait period **without changing the ECConnector  architecture**. Also, adapting the AsyncScheduler feature could provide asynchronous coordination between the encoder and prefill-decode stages, reducing the communication overhead.

Other reasons can produce this TTFT increasing, but most likely it can be handled by proper configuration/changes without architecture changes.

We also can note the general throughput improvements, with EPD achieving ~5% higher request throughput at 1000 prompts workload (10.12 vs 9.58 req/s) and output token throughput (1078 vs 1023 tok/s). By resolving TTFT-related issues and modifying the vllm architecture towards disaggregated serving, we can continue obtaining better results in distributed setting, as the current implementation already slightly demonstrates the benefits while leaving clear optimization opportunities.
